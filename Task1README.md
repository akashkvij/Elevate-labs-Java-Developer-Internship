This is a simple Java Console Calculator built as part of internship learning. The calculator allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations using the console.

Features
*Addition of two numbers
*Subtraction of two numbers
*Multiplication of two numbers
*Division of two numbers (with divide-by-zero handling)
*Menu-driven interface with loop (runs until user chooses exit)

Project Structure:
com.elevatelabs.internship
│
├── Calculator.java   // Contains methods for add, subtract, multiply, divide
└── Mainclass1.java   // Main class with console menu and user input

How It Works:
1.Run the Mainclass1 program.
2.A menu appears with choices (Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division, Exit).
3.User selects an operation.
4.Program asks for two numbers as input.
5.Calculator performs the selected operation and prints the result.
6.Loop continues until user selects "Exit".


Example run:
1:Addition
2:Subtraction
3:Multiplication
4:Division
5: exit
Enter your choice: 1
Enter the FirstNumber: 10
Enter the SecondNumber: 20
Addition of 10.0+20.0=30.0
